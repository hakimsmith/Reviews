# Horrific Reviews - A website dedicated to the world of horror movie criticism!

## Navigation Bar
Most pages display a navigation bar that gives the user the ability to navigate to one of two pages: The main menu ("Home") or the list of all movies ("Movies").

## Main Menu
Users will be presented with a list of horror movie genres, displayed with the genre name and a corresponding image. 
Clicking one of the listed genres will move them to a list of movies within that genre.

## Genre Page
All movies of a given genre are displayed here. Clicking on either the image or title of a movie will take the user to that movie's corresponding Details page.

## Details Page
Here, a brief description of the chosen movie is displayed alongside all of the reviews for that movie. Each review has two corresponding buttons, Delete and Edit, which allow the user to remove that review or change its contents, respectively. Above the list of reviews is a button, Add Review, that allows the user to add a review to the list of reviews for the chosen movie.

### Add, Delete, Edit
Each of these pages presents the user with the options needed to perform the action chosen from the Details Page. After the user completes the chosen action, they are redirected to the Details page for the previously chosen movie.
